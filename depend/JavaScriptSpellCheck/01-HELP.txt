Installing JavaScript SpellCheck is easy on any server that supports ASP, PHP or ASP.Net.... almost any modern web host.

There are no dependencies, plug-ins or ActiveX controls to install - the entire solution is self-contained.

The only caveat is that JavaScript SpellCheck will not work in a "file://" development environment (e.g. from your desktop) It will start working when you have uploaded to a web server - or on localhost.


  * Download JavaScriptSpellCheck.zip
  * Unzip The package
  * Copy it to the root folder of your website - such its url "/JavaScriptSpellCheck"
  * Open "/JavaScriptSpellCheck/02-TestInstall.html" in your browser to test installation. 


Notes:

  * If you are using an ASP.Net server - copy ASPNetSpell.dll from the zip package to the "/bin/ASPNetSpell.dll"
